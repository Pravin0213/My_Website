            Hello, I'm Praveen ðŸ‘‹
        </h1>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify">
            I currently work as a <span class="font-semibold text-white">Quantitative Risk Analyst</span> in the energy sector.
            What does that mean? I measure the risk of fire incidents in process facilities in case of leaks.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
            How do I measure risk? I run hundreds or even thousands of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations and
            aggregate the results. In addition to that, I assess how structures behave under fire exposure, estimate ship
            collision probabilities with offshore installations, and develop web-based simulation applications.
        </p>

        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
            With the growing usage of <span class="font-semibold text-white">Artificial Intelligence</span> in various fields,
            Firstly, I am surpised by how good AI has become at solving problems and then I got scared that it might take over my job soon.
            This made me curious about how does AI works? I wanted to learn about this tech to really comprehend the true potential of AI.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
            So, I started to explore the core mathematical concepts behind Nerual Networks. During this learning, I started working on projects
            to use this knowledge in practice. I thought it would be cool to show how this projects work on a web. So, I also started exploring
            <span class="font-semibold text-white">Web Development</span> technologies like Flask, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a website.
        <p class="text-gray-300 text-lg leading-relaxed text-justify mt-4">
            This website serves as my personal space to document and share the projects I'm building while learning these technologies.
